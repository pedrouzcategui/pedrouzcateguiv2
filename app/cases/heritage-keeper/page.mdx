_Made with ðŸ’˜ with Next.js_

**Heritage Keeper** is an app that was created for the **#CODICON2024** hosted by [LexPin](https://google.com).

## What it does?

It allows you to share _memories_ with _family members_ through _albums_.

## Why we created it?

The hackathon word of this year was _transmission_. We thought about
it (asked ChatGPT to give us 20 ideas for software projects with the word _transmission_) and we got the idea of making a family repository that could _transmit_ the memories of their families for generations.

Therefore: **Heritage Keeper** was born ðŸ¥³ (very creative right?!)

## How we created it?

Since Juan Alvarez, Alfredo Arvelaez and me are FullStack Developers, we planned the project from the beggining, and we made a quick excalidraw of the app and **we were up** ðŸ”¥

We decided with coin flips who were going to make what. I got the easiest part of the app in my opinion: **The memories feature.**

## Memories

The concept is really simple: A picture where you can tag people, add a description and a date.

Was there any difficult about creating this particular piece? _Honestly not_

The only thing I can remember being challenging, was the Prisma connections with the other models, but this isn't challenging, it just happened because I didn't read the library before.

That's why you can't rely on courses as your only source of knowledge kids!

As Juan says: _Programming is more about freestyling_.

Following patterns in programming doesn't teach anything, since is by freestyling that learn more about what those patterns solve.

Anyway, here is a picture of the actual feature I developed:

## The Hackathon

Not gonna lie, I like to win, but this was more a team effort than an me effort. So the attribution is shared.

However, I didn't feel that this hackathon was particularly demanding to me as other developers say.

I can list a couple of reasons:

- My team was f\*cking badass _(these guys are just too crazy good)_
- I know the tools that I was working with decently well
- I know the programming we were going to use, nothing fancy, no websockets, no manual stream of data via API, no complex Redux Thunks shit, no bitwise operators, nothing complex.

Thanks to those reasons, **we shipped as much as we could as safe as we could.**

## The results

When the stream started, I felt secure, since the projects I was seeing wasn't particularly better than ours.

There was probably around 3 or 4 projects that truly were amazing and implemented cool tech, however, they were not stable.

When the time came to present the project, I did the presentation, which honestly felt easy.

All of them were amazed by the UX of our application, which honestly I can thank to ShadCN for, since it includes a lot of stuff right of the bat and REALLY easy to use.

Also, Juan and Alfredo made the 3 most important pieces of the app:

1. The album viewer
2. The zip download
3. The album-memories filtering

Don't blame me! It was pure chance! Remember we did a ðŸª™ flip

## The final decision

Lexpin called Alfredo to inform of the decision they took.

We won! It felt truly rewarding. But personally, I didn't felt that was it.

I mean, Juan and Alfredo are way better than I am at the moment, and I want to be able to become better so I can support them how they supported me in the hackathon.

It means that I need to learn more about the tools we are using, about AI, about more atonishing graphic techinques, 3D, and more stuff to come.

This is the beggining of a great journey, and I'm more than happy because I got to experience this moment with my friends.
